is said and done  [Verse 2] In our lives, we have walked some strange and lonely treks Slightly worn, but dignified, and not too old for sex We're still striving for the sky No taste for humble pie

said and done [Outro] Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done[Verse 1] I have a very good friend The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend She has a personal style Some people like it, others tend to go wild You hear her voice everywhere Taking the chair She's a leading lady And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

heels, setting the pace Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace She's extreme, if you know what I mean  [Verse 2] Her man is one I admire He's so courageous but he's constantly tired Each time when he speaks his mind She pats his head and says, ""Oh, that's all very fine Exert that will of your own When you're alone Now we'd better hurry"" And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going [Chorus] Head over heels, breaking her way Pushing through unknown jungles every day She's a girl with a taste for the world (The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing) Head over heels, setting

please) And she goes head over heels[Verse 1: Agnetha] I must have left my house at eight because I always do My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due I must have read the morning paper going into town And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed I must have gone to lunch At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained The day before you came  [Verse 2: Agnetha] I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two And at the time I never even noticed I was blue I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school The train back home again Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame The day before you came  [Vocalisations: Frida]  [Verse 3: Agnetha] I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then I must have read a while The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim The day before you came  [Outro: Agnetha] And turning out the light I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain The day before you came  [Vocalisations: Frida][Verse 1] Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go My resistance running low And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so (You know that I'm nobody's fool) I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me I don't have a strategy It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be  [Chorus] Under attack, I'm being taken About to crack, defences breaking Won't somebody please have a heart Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart Under attack, I'm taking cover He's on my track, my chasing lover Thinking nothing can stop him now Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how  [Verse 2] This is getting crazy, I should tell him so Really let my anger show Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no (I'm kind of certain I suppose) Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well Something like a magic spell I hardly dare to think of what would happen, where I'd be if I fell [Chorus] Under attack, I'm being taken About to crack, defences breaking Won't somebody please have a heart Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart Under attack, I'm taking cover He's on my track, my chasing lover Thinking nothing's gonna stop him now Should I want to, I'm not sure I won't know how  [Interlude]  [Chorus] Under attack, I'm being taken About to crack, defences breaking Won't somebody see and save a heart Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart Under attack, I'm taking cover He's on my track, my chasing lover Thinking nothing can stop him now Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how  [Outro] Under attack, I'm being taken About to crack, defences breaking Won't somebody please have a heart Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart Under attack, I'm taking cover[Refrain] Keep thinking about his angeleyes I keep thinking  [Verse 1] Last night I was taking a walk along the river And I saw him together with a young girl And the look that he gave her made me shiver Because he always used to look at me that way And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say ""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""  [Chorus] Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised He'll take your heart and you must pay the price Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise Don't look too deep into those angeleyes Oh no, no, no, no  [Refrain] Keep thinking about his angeleyes I keep thinking  [Verse 2] Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him And it hurts to remember all the good times When I thought I could never live without him And I wonder does it have to be the same? Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain? Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?  [Chorus] Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised He'll take your heart and you must pay the price Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise Don't look too deep into his angeleyes Crazy 'bout his angeleyes, angeleyes He took my heart and now I pay the price Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise Don't look too deep into those angeleyes Oh no, no, no, no  [Outro] Keep thinking Keep thinking about his angeleyes I keep thinking Keep thinking, had to pay the price Keep thinking Keep thinking about his angeleyes I keep thinking Keep thinking, had to pay the price Keep thinking[Verso 1] Chiquitita, dime por qué Tu dolor hoy te encadena En tus ojos hay, una sombra de gran pena No quisiera verte así Aunque quieras disimularlo Si es que tan triste estás para qué quieres callarlo  [Verso 2] Chiquitita, dímelo tu En mi hombro, aquí llorando Cuenta conmigo ya, para así seguir andando Tan segura te conocí Y ahora tu ala quebrada (Duele verte triste) (Y duele verte llorar) Déjamela arreglar, yo la quiero ver curada  [Coro] Chiquitita, sabes muy bien Que las penas vienen Y van y desaparecen Otra vez vas a bailar Y serás feliz Como flores que florecen Chiquitita, no hay que llorar Las estrellas brillan por Ti allá en lo alto Quiero verte sonreír Para compartir Tu alegría, Chiquitita Otra vez quiero compartir Tu alegría Chiquitita [Verso 3] Chiquitita, dime por qué Tu dolor hoy te encadena En tus ojos hay, una sombra de gran pena No quisiera verte así Aunque quieras disimularlo Si es que tan triste estás para qué quieres callarlo  [Coro] Chiquitita, sabes muy bien Que las penas vienen Y van y desaparecen Otra vez vas a bailar Y serás feliz Como flores que florecen Chiquitita, no hay que llorar Las estrellas brillan por Ti allá en lo alto Quiero verte sonreír Para compartir Tu alegría, Chiquitita Otra vez quiero compartir Tu alegría Chiquitita  [Outro] Otra vez quiero compartir Tu alegría Chiquitita[Verse 1] Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong You're enchained by your own sorrow In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow How I hate to see you like this There is no way you can deny it I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet  [Verse 2] Chiquitita, tell me the truth I'm a shoulder you can cry on Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on You were always sure of yourself Now, I see you've broken a feather (How it hurts to see you cry) (And how it hurts to see you sad) I hope we can patch it up together  [Chorus] Chiquitita, you and I know How the heartaches come and they go And the scars they're leaving You'll be dancing once again And the pain will end You will have no time for grieving Chiquitita, you and I cry But the sun is still in the sky And shining above you (Even though you cry) (The sun is shining in the sky) Let me hear you sing once more (So let me hear you sing some more) Like you did before (The way you used to do before) Sing a new song, Chiquitita Try once more, like you did before Sing a new song, Chiquitita [Verse 3] So the walls came tumbling down And your love's a blown-out candle All is gone, and it seems too hard to handle Chiquitita, tell me the truth There is no way you can deny it I see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet  [Chorus] Chiquitita, you and I know How the heartaches come and they go And the scars they're leaving (You and I, we know) (How all the heartaches come and go) You'll be dancing once again (You’ll be dancing once again) And the pain will end (And all the pain you take will end) You will have no time for grieving Chiquitita, you and I cry But the sun is still in the sky And shining above you (Even though you cry) (The sun is shining in the sky) Let me hear you sing once more (So let me hear you sing some more) Like you did before (The way you used to do before) Sing a new song, Chiquitita Try once more, like you did before Sing a new song, Chiquitita [Outro] Try once more, like you did before Sing a new song, Chiquitita[Verse 1] You're so hot, teasing me So you're blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you That's something I couldn't do There's that look in your eyes I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild Ah, but girl, you're only a child  [Chorus] Well I can dance with you, honey If you think it's funny Does your mother know that you're out?

With your pockets well protected at last And your streetcar visions which ya' place on the grass And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass Who could they get to carry you?  [Chorus] Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums Should I put them by your gate Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?  [Verse 2] With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace And your basement clothes and your hollow face Who among them can think he could outguess you? With your silhouette when the sunlight dims Into your eyes where the moonlight swims And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns Who among them would try to impress you? [Chorus] Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums Should I put them by your gate Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?  [Verse 3] The kings of Tyrus with their convict list Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss And ya' wouldn’t know it woulda' happened like this But a'who among them really wants just to kiss you? With your childhood flames on your midnight rug And your Spanish manners and your mother’s drugs And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs Who among them do ya' think could resist you?  [Chorus] Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums Should I leave them by your gate Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?  [Verse 4] Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side? How could they ever mistake you? They wished you’d accepted the blame for the farm But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms How could they ever have persuaded you? [Chorus] Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums Should I leave them by your gate Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?  [Verse 5] With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go And your gentleness now, which you just can’t help but show Who among them do you think would employ you? Now you stand with your thief, you’re on his parole With your holy medallion an' your fingertips now that fold And your saintlike face and your ghost-like soul Who among them could ever think it could destroy you?  [Chorus] Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums Should I leave them by your gate Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?(Intro)  Oh, the ragman draws circles Up and down the block I’d ask him what the matter was But I know that he don’t talk And the ladies treat me kindly And they furnish me with tape But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape  Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again  Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley With his pointed shoes and his bells Speaking to some French girl Who says she knows me well And I would send a message To find out if she’s talked But the post office has been stolen And the mailbox is locked  Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again  Mona tried to tell me To stay away from the train line She said that all the railroad men Just drink up your blood like wine And I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that But then again, there’s only one I’ve met And he just smoked my eyelids And punched my cigarette”  Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again  Grandpa died last week And now he’s buried in the rocks But everybody still talks about How badly they were shocked But me, I expected it to happen I knew he’d lost control When I, he built a fire on Main Street And shot it full of holes  Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again  Now the senator came down here Showing everyone his gun Handing out free tickets To the wedding of his son And me, I nearly got busted And wouldn’t it be my luck To get caught without a ticket And be discovered beneath a truck  Oh, Mama, is this really the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again  Now the tea preacher looked so baffled When I asked him why he dressed With twenty pounds of headlines Stapled to his chest But he cursed me when I proved to him Then I whispered, said “Not even you can hide You see, you’re just like me I hope you’re satisfied”  Aw, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again  Now the rainman gave me two cures Then he said, “Jump right in” The one was Texas medicine The other was just railroad gin And like a fool I mixed them And it strangled up my mind And now people just get uglier And I have no sense of time  Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again  When Ruthie says come see her In her honky-tonk lagoon Where I can watch her waltz for free ’Neath her Panamanian moon And I say, “Aw come on now You know ya' know about my debutante” And she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need But I know what you want”  Oh, Mama, can this really be the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again  Now the bricks lay on Grand Street Where the neon madmen climb They all fall there so perfectly It all seems so well timed And here I sit so patiently Waiting to find out what price You have to pay to get out of Going through all these things twice  Oh, Mama, is this really the end To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues againAin’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin' to be so quiet? We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it Lights flicker from the opposite loft In this room the heat pipes just cough The country music station plays soft But there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off Just Louise and her lover so entwined And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind  In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chain And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” train We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight Ask himself if it’s him or them that’s really insane Louise, she’s all right, she’s just near She’s delicate and seems like the mirror But she just makes it all too concise and too clear That Johanna’s not here The ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place  Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously And when bringing her name up He speaks of a farewell kiss to me He’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all Muttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hall How can I explain? It's so hard to get on And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues You can tell by the way she smiles See the primitive wallflower freeze When the jelly-faced women all sneeze Hear the one with the mustache say, “Jeeze I can’t find my knees” Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel  The peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him Sayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him” But like Louise always says “Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?” As she, herself, prepares for him And Madonna, she still has not showed We see this empty cage now corrode Where her cape of the stage once had flowed The fiddler, he now steps to the road He writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed On the back of the fish truck that loads While my conscience explodes The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain[Verse 1] Someone’s got it in for me They’re planting stories in the press Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it out quick But when they will I can only guess They say I shot a man named Gray And took his wife to Italy She inherited a million bucks And when she died it came to me I can’t help it if I’m lucky  [Verse 2] People see me all the time And they just can’t remember how to act Their minds are filled with big ideas Images and distorted facts Even you, yesterday You had to ask me where it was at I couldn’t believe after all these years You didn’t know me any better than that Sweet lady  [Chorus] Idiot wind Blowing every time you move your mouth Blowing down the backroads heading south Idiot wind Blowing every time you move your teeth You’re an idiot, babe It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe  [Verse 3] I ran into the fortune-teller Who said beware of lightning that might strike I haven’t known peace and quiet For so long, I can’t remember what it’s like There’s a lone soldier on the cross Smoke pouring out of a boxcar door You didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done In the final end he won the war After losing every battle  [Verse 4] I woke up on the roadside Daydreaming about the way things sometimes are Visions of your chestnut mare Shoot through my head and are making me see stars You hurt the ones that I love best And cover up the truth with lies One day you’ll be in the ditch Flies buzzing around your eyes Blood on your saddle  [Chorus] Idiot wind Blowing through the flowers on your tomb Blowing through the curtains in your room Idiot wind Blowing every time you move your teeth You’re an idiot, babe It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe  [Verse 5] It was gravity which pulled us down And destiny which broke us apart You tamed the lion in my cage But it just wasn’t enough to change my heart Now everything’s a little upside down As a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good You’ll find out when you reach the top You’re on the bottom  [Verse 6] I noticed at the ceremony Your corrupt ways had finally made you blind I can’t remember your face anymore Your mouth has changed, your eyes don’t look into mine The priest wore black on the seventh day And sat stone-faced while the building burned I waited for you on the running boards Near the cypress trees, while the Spring time turned Slowly into Autumn  [Chorus] Idiot wind Blowing like a circle around my skull From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol Idiot wind Blowing every time you move your teeth You’re an idiot, babe It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe  [Verse 7] I can’t feel you anymore I can’t even touch the books you’ve read Every time I crawl past your door I been wishing I've been somebody else instead Down the highway, down the tracks Down the road to ecstasy I followed you beneath the stars Hounded by your memory And all your raging glory  [Verse 8] I been double-crossed now For the very last time and now I’m finally free I kissed goodbye the howling beast On the borderline which separated you from me You’ll never know the hurt I suffered Nor the pain I rise above And I’ll never know the same about you Your holiness or your kind of love And it makes me feel so sorry  [Chorus] Idiot wind Blowing through the buttons of our coats Blowing through the letters that we wrote Idiot wind Blowing through the dust upon our shelves We’re idiots, babe It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves[Verse 1] 'Twas in another lifetime One of toil and blood When blackness was a virtue The road was full of mud I came in from the wilderness A creature void of form ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya Shelter from the storm""  [Verse 2] And if I pass this way again You can rest assured I'll always do my best for her On that I give my word In a world of steel-eyed death and men Who are fighting to be warm ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya Shelter from the storm""  [Verse 3] Not a word was spoke between us There was little risk involved Everything up to that point Had been left unresolved Try imagining a place Where it's always safe and warm ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya Shelter from the storm"" [Verse 4] I was burned out from exhaustion Buried in the hail Poisoned in the bushes And blown out on the trail Hunted like a crocodile Ravaged in the corn ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya Shelter from the storm""  [Verse 5] Suddenly I turned around And she was standing there With silver bracelets on her wrists And flowers in her hair She walked up to me so gracefully And took my crown of thorns ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya Shelter from the storm""  [Verse 6] Now there's a wall between us Something there's been lost I took too much for granted I got my signals crossed Just to think that it all began On an uneventful morn ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya Shelter from the storm"" [Verse 7] Well the deputy walks on hard nails And the preacher rides a mount But nothing really matters much It's doom alone that counts And the one-eyed undertaker He blows a futile horn ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya Shelter from the storm  [Verse 8] I've heard newborn babies wailing Like a mourning dove And old men with broken teeth Stranded without love Do I understand your question, then Is it hopeless and forlorn ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya Shelter from the storm""  [Verse 9] In a little hilltop village They gambled for my clothes I bargained for salvation And she gave me a lethal dose I offered up my innocence And I got repaid with scorn ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya Shelter from the storm"" [Verse 10] Well, I'm living in a foreign country But I'm bound to cross the line Beauty walks a razor's edge Someday I'll make it mine If I could only turn back the clock To when God and her were born ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya Shelter from the storm""[Verse 1] They sat together in the park As the evening sky grew dark She looked at him and he felt a spark Tingle to his bones 'Twas then he felt alone And wished that he'd gone straight And watched out for a simple twist of fate  [Verse 2] They walked alone by the old canal A little confused, I remember well And stopped into a strange hotel With a neon burning bright He felt the heat of the night Hit him like a freight train Moving with a simple twist of fate  [Verse 3] A saxophone someplace far-off played As she was walking on by the arcade As the light bust through a beat-up shade Where he was wakin' up She dropped a coin into the cup Of a blind man at the gate And forgot about a simple twist of fate  [Verse 4] He woke up, the room was bare He didn't see her anywhere He told himself he didn't care Pushed the window open wide Felt an emptiness inside To which he just could not relate Brought on by a simple twist of fate  [Verse 5] He hears the ticking of the clocks And walks along with a parrot that talks Hunts her down by the waterfront docks Where the sailors all come in Maybe she'll pick him out again How long must he wait? One more time, for a simple twist of fate  [Verse 6] People tell me it's a sin To know and feel too much within I still believe she was my twin But I lost the ring She was born in spring But I was born too late Blame it on a simple twist of fate[Verse 1] Early one morning the sun was shining I was laying in bed Wondering if she'd changed at all If her hair was still red Her folks they said our lives together Sure was going to be rough They never did like Mama's homemade dress Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough And I was standing on the side of the road Rain falling on my shoes Heading out for the East Coast Lord knows I've paid some dues Getting through Tangled up in blue  [Verse 2] She was married when we first met Soon to be divorced I helped her out of a jam, I guess But I used a little too much force We drove that car as far as we could Abandoned it out West Split up on a dark sad night Both agreeing it was best She turned around to look at me As I was walking away I heard her say over my shoulder ""We'll meet again someday On the avenue"" Tangled up in blue [Verse 3] I had a job in the great north woods Working as a cook for a spell But I never did like it all that much And one day the ax just fell So I drifted down to New Orleans Where I lucky was to be employed Working for a while on a fishing boat Right outside of Delacroix But all the while I was alone The past was close behind I seen a lot of women But she never escaped my mind And I just grew Tangled up in blue  [Verse 4] She was working in a topless place And I stopped in for a beer I just kept looking at the side of her face In the spotlight, so clear And later on, when the crowd thinned out I was just about to do the same She was standing there, in back of my chair Said to me ""Tell me, don't I know your name?"" I muttered something underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face I must admit, I felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces Of my shoe Tangled up in blue [Verse 5] She lit a burner on the stove And offered me a pipe ""I thought you'd never say hello"" she said ""You look like the silent type"" Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burning coal Pouring off of every page Like it was written in my soul From me to you Tangled up in blue  [Verse 6] I lived with them on Montague Street In a basement down the stairs There was music in the cafes at night And revolution in the air Then he started into dealing with slaves And something inside of him died She had to sell everything she owned And froze up inside And when it finally, the bottom fell out I became withdrawn The only thing I knew how to do Was to keep on keeping on Like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue [Verse 7] So now I'm going back again I got to get to her somehow All the people we used to know They're an illusion to me now Some are mathematicians Some are carpenter's wives Don't know how it all got started I don't know what they're doing with their lives But me, I'm still on the road A-heading for another joint We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point Of view Tangled up in blue[Verse 1] I’ve seen love go by my door It’s never been this close before Never been so easy or so slow I've been shooting in the dark too long When something’s not right, it’s wrong You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  [Verse 2] Dragon clouds so high above I’ve only known careless love It always just hit me from below But this time 'round it’s more correct Right on target, so direct You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  [Verse 3] Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace Crimson hair across your face You could make me cry, if you don’t know Can’t remember what I was thinking of You might be spoilin’ me too much, love You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  [Bridge 1] Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme Blue river running slow and lazy I could stay with you forever and never realize the time [Verse 4] Situations have ended sad Relationships have all been bad Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud But there’s no way I can compare All them scenes to this affair You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  [Bridge 2] You're gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’ Staying far behind without you You're gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’ You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to  [Verse 5] I’ll look for you in old Honolulu San Francisco or Ashtabula You're gonna have to leave me now, I know But I’ll see you in the sky above In the tall grass, in the ones I love You're gonna make me lonesome when you go[Verse 1] You got a lot of nerve To say you are my friend When I was down You just stood there grinning  [Verse 2] You got a lot of nerve To say you got a helping hand to lend You just want to be on The side that’s winning  [Verse 3] You say I let you down You know it’s not like that If you’re so hurt Why then don’t you show it?  [Verse 4] You say you lost your faith But that’s not where it’s at You had no faith to lose And you know it  [Verse 5] I know the reason That you talk behind my back I used to be among the crowd You’re in with [Verse 5] Do you take me for such a fool To think I’d make contact With the one who tries to hide What he don’t know to begin with  [Verse 6] You see me on the street You always act surprised You say “How are you? Good luck!” But you don’t mean it  [Verse 7] When you know as well as me You’d rather see me paralyzed Why don’t you just come out once And scream it  [Verse 8] No, I do not feel that good When I see the heartbreaks you embrace If I was a master thief Perhaps I’d rob them  [Verse 9] And now I know you’re dissatisfied With your position and your place Don’t you understand It’s not my problem [Verse 10] I wish that for just one time You could stand inside my shoes And just for that one moment I could be you  [Verse 11] Yes, I wish that for just one time You could stand inside my shoes You’d know what a drag it is To see you[Verse 1] You must leave now Take what you need, you think will last But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast Yonder stands your orphan with his gun Crying like a fire in the sun  [Chorus] Look out, the saints are coming through And it's all over now, Baby Blue  [Verse 2] The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense Take what you have gathered from coincidence The empty handed painter from your streets Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets  [Chorus] The sky, too, is folding under you And it's all over now, Baby Blue  [Verse 3] All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home Your empty handed armies are going home Your lover who just walked out the door Has taken all his blankets from the floor  [Chorus] The carpet, too, is moving under you And it's all over now, Baby Blue  [Verse 4] Leave your stepping stones behind There's something that calls for you Forget the dead you've left They will not follow you The vagabond who's rapping at your door Is standing in the clothes that you once wore  [Chorus] Strike another match, go start anew And it's all over now, Baby Blue[Verse 1] Darkness at the break of noon Shadows even the silver spoon The handmade blade, the child's balloon Eclipses both the sun and moon To understand you know too soon There is no sense in trying  [Verse 2] Pointed threats they bluff with scorn Suicide remarks are torn From the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn Plays wasted words, proves to warn That he not busy being born Is busy dying  [Verse 3] Temptation's page flies out the door You follow, find yourself at war Watch waterfalls of pity roar You feel to moan, but unlike before You discover that you'd just be one more Person crying  [Chorus] So don't fear if you hear A foreign sound to your ear It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing [Verse 4] As some warn victory, some downfall Private reasons, great or small Can be seen in the eyes of those that call To make all that should be killed to crawl While others say don't hate nothing at all Except hatred  [Verse 5] Disillusioned words like bullets bark As human gods aim for their mark Make everything from toy guns that spark To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark It's easy to see without lookin' too far That not much is really sacred  [Verse 6] While preachers preach of evil fates Teachers teach that knowledge waits Can lead to hundred-dollar plates Goodness hides behind its gates But even the President of the United States Sometimes must have to stand naked  [Chorus] And though the rules of the road have been lodged It's only people's games that you got to dodge And it's alright, Ma, I can make it [Verse 7] Advertising signs that con You into thinking you're the one That can do what's never been done That can win what's never been won Meantime, life outside goes on All around you  [Verse 8] You lose yourself, you reappear You suddenly find you got nothing to fear Alone you stand with nobody near When a trembling distant voice, unclear Startles your sleeping ears to hear That somebody thinks they really found you  [Verse 9] A question in your nerves is lit Yet you know there is no answer fit To satisfy, ensure you not to quit To keep it in your mind and not forget That it is not he, or she, or them, or it That you belong to  [Chorus] But though the masters make the rules For the wise men and the fools I got nothing, Ma, to live up to [Verse 10] For them that must obey authority That they do not respect in any degree Who despise their jobs, their destiny Speak jealously of them that are free Do what they do just to be Nothing more than something they invest in  [Verse 11] While some on principles baptized To strict party platform ties Social clubs in drag disguise Outsiders they can freely criticize Tell nothing except who to idolize And say ""God bless him""  [Verse 12] While one who sings with his tongue on fire Gargles in the rat race choir Bent out of shape from society's pliers Cares not to come up any higher But rather get you down in the hole That he's in  [Chorus] But I mean no harm, nor put fault On anyone that lives in a vault But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him  [Verse 13] Old lady judges watch people in pairs Limited in sex, they dare To push fake morals, insult and stare While money doesn't talk, it swears Obscenity, who really cares Propaganda, all is phony  [Verse 14] While them that defend what they cannot see With a killer's pride, security It blows the minds most bitterly For them that think death's honesty Won't fall upon 'em naturally Life sometimes must get lonely  [Verse 15] My eyes collide head-on with stuffed Graveyards, false goals, I scuff At pettiness which plays so rough Walk upside down inside handcuffs Kick my legs to crash it off Say, okay, I've had enough What else can you show me?  [Chorus] And if my thought-dreams could be seen They'd probably put my head in a guillotine But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life onlyMy love she speaks like silence Without ideals or violence She doesn't have to say she's faithful Yet she's true, like ice, like fire  People carry roses And make promises by the hours My love she laughs like the flowers Valentines can't buy her  In the dime stores and bus stations People talk of situations Read books, repeat quotations Draw conclusions on the wall  Some speak of the future My love she speaks softly She knows there's no success like failure And that failure's no success at all  The cloak and dagger dangles Madams light the candles In ceremonies of the horsemen Even a pawn must hold a grudge  Statues made of match sticks Crumble into one another My love winks, she does not bother She knows too much to argue or to judge  The bridge at midnight trembles The country doctor rambles Bankers' nieces seek perfection Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring  The wind howls like a hammer The night blows rainy My love she's like some raven At my window with a broken wing[Verse 1] I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more Well, I wake up in the morning Fold my hands and pray for rain I got a head full of ideas That are drivin' me insane  [Bridge] It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  [Verse 2] I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more Well, he hands you a nickel He hands you a dime He asks you with a grin If you're having a good time  [Bridge] Then he fines you every time you slam the door I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  [Verse 3] I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more Well, he puts his cigar Out in your face just for kicks His bedroom window It is made out of bricks [Bridge] The National Guard stands around his door Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more  [Verse 4] I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more Well, she talks to all the servants About man and God and law Everybody says She's the brains behind Pa  [Bridge] She's 68, but she says she's 54 I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more  [Verse 5] I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more Well, I try my best To be just like I am But everybody wants you To be just like them  [Bridge] They say ""Sing while you slave"" and I just get bored Ah, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more[Chorus] Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you  [Verse 1] Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand Vanished from my hand Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping My weariness amazes me, I am branded on my feet I have no one to meet And my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming  [Chorus] Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you  [Verse 2] Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels To be wandering I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade Into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way I promise to go under it  [Chorus] Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you  [Verse 3] Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run And but for the sky there are no fences facing And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind I wouldn't pay it any mind It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing  [Chorus] Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you  [Verse 4] And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves Let me forget about today until tomorrow  [Chorus] Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you[Verse 1] Johnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off Look out kid, it's somethin' you did God knows when, but you're doin' it again You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend The man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen Wants 11 dollar bills – you only got 10  [Verse 2] Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed, but Phone's tapped anyway Maggie says the many say They must bust in early May, orders from the D.A."" Look out kid, don't matter what you did Walk on your tip toes, don’t tie no bows Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows  [Verse 3] Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell Try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail Look out kid, you're gonna get hit By losers, cheaters, six-time users Hanging 'round the theaters Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool Don't follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters [Verse 4] Oh, get born, keep warm Short pants, romance Learn to dance, get dressed Get blessed, try to be a success Please her, please him, buy gifts Don't steal, don't lift 20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift Look out kid, they keep it all hid Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals Don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles[Verse 1] Who's got a beard that's long and white? Santa's got a beard that's long and white Who comes around on a special night? Santa comes around on a special night  Special Night, beard that's white  [Chorus] Must be Santa Must be Santa Must be Santa, Santa Clause  [Verse 2] Who wears boots and a suit of red? Santa wears boots and a suit of red Who wears a long cap on his head? Santa wears a long cap on his head  Cap on head, suit that's red Special night, beard that's white  [Chorus] Must be Santa Must be Santa Must be Santa, Santa Clause [Verse 3] Who's got a big red cherry nose? Santa's got a big red cherry nose Who laughs this way - ""HO HO HO""? Santa laughs this way ""HO HO HO""  HO HO HO, cherry nose Cap on head, suit that's red Special night, beard that's white  [Chorus] Must be Santa Must be Santa Must be Santa, Santa Clause  [Verse 4] Who very soon will come our way? Santa very soon will come our way Eight little reindeer pull his sleigh? Santa's little reindeer pull his sleigh  Reindeer sleigh, come our way HO HO HO, cherry nose Cap on head, suit that's red Special night, beard that's white [Chorus] Must be Santa Must be Santa Must be Santa, Santa Clause  [Verse 5] Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton  Reindeer sleigh, come our way HO HO HO, cherry nose Cap on head, suit that's red Special night, beard that's white  [Chorus] Must be Santa Must be Santa Must be Santa, Santa Clause Must be Santa Must be Santa Must be Santa, Santa Clause[Verse 1] Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall She sees the bartender in a pool of blood Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!” Here comes the story of the Hurricane The man the authorities came to blame For something that he never done Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been The champion of the world  [Verse 2] Three bodies lying there does Patty see And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously “I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands “I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops “One of us had better call up the cops” And so Patty calls the cops And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing In the hot New Jersey night  [Verse 3] Meanwhile, far away in another part of town Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around Number one contender for the middleweight crown Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road Just like the time before and the time before that In Paterson that’s just the way things go If you’re black you might as well not show up on the street Unless you want to draw the heat [Verse 4] Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around He said, “I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates” And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead” So they took him to the infirmary And though this man could hardly see They told him that he could identify the guilty men  [Verse 5] Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye Says, “Why did you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!” Yes, here’s the story of the Hurricane The man the authorities came to blame For something that he never done Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been The champion of the world  [Verse 6] Four months later, the ghettos are in flame Rubin’s in South America, fighting for his name While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame “Remember that murder that happened in a bar?” “Remember you said you saw the getaway car?” “You think you’d like to play ball with the law?” “Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw running that night?” “Don’t forget that you are white” [Verse 7] Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure” Cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break We got you for the motel job and we’re talking to your friend Bello Now you don’t want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow You’ll be doing society a favor That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver We want to put his ass in stir We want to pin this triple murder on him He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”  [Verse 8] Rubin could take a man out with just one punch But he never did like to talk about it all that much ""It’s my work,"" he’d say, ""and I do it for pay And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way"" Up to some paradise Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice And ride a horse along a trail But then they took him to the jailhouse Where they try to turn a man into a mouse  [Verse 9] All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger No one doubted that he pulled the trigger And though they could not produce the gun The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed And the all-white jury agreed [Verse 10] Rubin Carter was falsely tried The crime was murder “one,” guess who testified? Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride How can the life of such a man Be in the palm of some fool’s hand? To see him obviously framed Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land Where justice is a game  [Verse 11] Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell An innocent man in a living hell That’s the story of the Hurricane But it won’t be over till they clear his name And give him back the time he’s done Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been The champion of the world[Verse 1] You walk into the room With your pencil in your hand You see somebody naked And you, you say, ""Who is that man?"" You try so hard But you don't understand Just what you will say When you get home  [Refrain] Because something is happening here But ya' don't know what it is Do you, Mister Jones?  [Verse 2] You raise up your head And you ask ""Is this where it is?"" And somebody points to you and says ""It's his"" And you say ""What's mine?"" And somebody else says ""Well, what is?"" And you say, ""Oh my God, am I here all alone?""  [Refrain] But something is happening And ya' don't know what it is Do you, Mister Jones?  [Verse 3] You hand in your ticket And you go watch the geek Who immediately walks up to you When he hears you speak And says ""How does it feel to Be such a freak?"" And you say, ""Impossible"" As he hands you a bone  [Refrain] And something is happening here But ya' don't know what it is Do you, Mister Jones?  [Verse 4] You have many contacts Among the lumberjacks To get you facts When someone attacks your imagination But nobody has any respect Anyway they already expect you To all give a check To tax-deductible charity organization Aw, you've been with the professors And they've all liked your looks With great lawyers you have Discussed lepers and crooks You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books You are very well read It's well known  [Refrain] But something is happening here And ya' don't know what it is Do you, Mister Jones?  [Verse 5] Well the sword swallower, he comes up to you And then he kneels He crosses himself And then he clicks his high heels And without further notice He asks you how it feels And he says, ""Here is your throat back Thanks for the loan""  [Refrain] And you know something is happening But ya' don't know what it is Do you, Mr. Jones?  [Verse 6] Now you see this one-eyed midget Shouting the word ""Now"" And you say, ""For what reason?"" And he says, ""How?"" And you say, ""What does this mean?"" And he screams back ""You're a cow Give me some milk or else go home""  [Refrain] And you know something's happening But ya' don't know what it is Do you, Mr. Jones?  [Verse 7] Well, you walk into the room Like a camel and then you frown You put your eyes in your pocket And your nose on the ground There oughtta be a law Against you comin' around You should be made To wear earphones  [Refrain] 'Cause something is happening And ya' don't know what it is Do you, Mr. Jones?They’re selling postcards of the hanging They’re painting the passports brown The beauty parlor is filled with sailors The circus is in town Here comes the blind commissioner They’ve got him in a trance One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker The other is in his pants And the riot squad, they’re restless They need somewhere to go As Lady and I look out tonight From Desolation Row  Cinderella, she seems so easy ""It takes one to know one"", she smiles And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning “You Belong to Me I Believe” And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend You'd better leave” And the only sound that’s left After the ambulances go Is Cinderella sweeping up On Desolation Row  Now the moon is almost hidden The stars are beginning to hide The fortune-telling lady Has even taken all her things inside All except for Cain and Abel And The Hunchback of Notre Dame Everybody is making love Or else expecting rain And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing He’s getting ready for the show He’s going to the carnival tonight On Desolation Row  Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window For her I feel so afraid On her twenty-second birthday She already is an old maid To her, death is quite romantic She wears an iron vest Her profession’s her religion Her sin is her lifelessness And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah’s great rainbow She spends her time peeking Into Desolation Row  Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood With his memories in a trunk Passed this way an hour ago With his friend, a jealous monk Now he looked so immaculately frightful As he bummed a cigarette Then he went off sniffing drainpipes And reciting the alphabet You would not think to look at him But he was famous long ago For playing the electric violin On Desolation Row  Dr. Filth, he keeps his world Inside of a leather cup But all his sexless patients They’re trying to blow it up Now his nurse, some local loser She’s in charge of the cyanide hole And she also keeps the cards that read “Have Mercy on His Soul” They all play on the pennywhistle You can hear them blow If you lean your head out far enough From Desolation Row  Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains They’re getting ready for the feast The Phantom of the Opera In a perfect image of a priest They are spoon feeding Casanova To get him to feel more assured Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence After poisoning him with words And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls “Get outta here if you don’t know Casanova is just being punished for going To Desolation Row”  At midnight all the agents And the superhuman crew Come out and round up everyone That knows more than they do Then they bring them to the factory Where the heart attack machine Is strapped across their shoulders And then the kerosene Is brought down from the castles By insurance men who go Check to see that nobody is escaping To Desolation Row  Praise be to Nero’s Neptune The Titanic sails at dawn Everybody’s shouting “Which side are you on?” And Ezra Pound and T. S.

DeMille He could die happily ever after [Chorus] Mama’s in the factory She ain't got no shoes Daddy’s in the alley He’s lookin' for food I am in the kitchen With the tombstone blues  [Verse 6] Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul To the old folks home and the college Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain That could hold you dear lady from going insane That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain Of your useless and pointless knowledge  [Chorus] Mama’s in the factory She ain't got no shoes Daddy’s in the alley He’s lookin' for food I am in the kitchen With the tombstone blues[Verse 1] ""There must be some way out of here"" Said the joker to the thief ""There's too much confusion I can't get no relief Businessmen, they drink my wine Plowmen dig my earth None of them along the line Know what any of it is worth""  [Verse 2] ""No reason to get excited"" The thief, he kindly spoke ""There are many here among us Who feel that life is but a joke But you and I, we've been through that And this is not our fate So let us not talk falsely now

[Verse 20] His men and his companions Were nowhere to be seen In silence there he waited for Time and space to intervene  [Verse 21] The passageway was narrow There was blackness in the air He saw every kind of sorrow Heard voices everywhere  [Verse 22] Alarm-bells were ringing To hold back the swelling tide Friends and lovers clinging To each other side by side  [Verse 23] Mothers and their daughters Descending down the stairs Jumped into the icy waters Love and pity sent their prayers  [Verse 24] The rich man, Mister Astor Kissed his darling wife He had no way of knowing Be the last trip of his life  [Verse 25] Calvin, Blake, and Wilson Gambled in the dark Not one of them would ever live to Tell the tale or disembark  [Verse 26] Brother rose up 'gainst brother In every circumstance They fought and slaughtered each other In a deadly dance  [Verse 27] They lowered down the lifeboats From the sinking wreck There were traitors, there were turncoats Broken backs and broken necks  [Verse 28] The bishop left his cabin To help all those in need Turned his eyes up to the heavens Said, ""The poor are yours to feed""  [Verse 29] Davey the brothel-keeper Came out dismissed his girls Saw the water getting deeper Saw the changing of his world  [Verse 30] Jim Backus smiled He never learned to swim Saw the little crippled child And he gave his seat to him  [Verse 31] He saw the starlight shining Streaming from the East Death was on the rampage But his heart was now at peace  [Verse 32] They battened down the hatches But the hatches wouldn't hold They drowned upon the staircase Of brass and polished gold  [Verse 33] Leo said to Cleo I think I'm going mad But he'd lost his mind already Whatever mind he had  [Verse 34] He tried to block the doorway To save all those from harm Blood from an open wound Pouring down his arm  [Verse 35] Petals fell from flowers Tell all of them were gone In the long and dreadful hours The wizard's curse played on  [Verse 36] The host was pouring brandy He was going down slow He stayed right to the end and he Was the last to go  [Verse 37] There were many, many others Nameless here forever more They never sailed the ocean Or left their homes before  [Verse 38] The watchman, he lay dreaming The damage had been done He dreamed the Titanic was sinking And he tried to tell someone  [Verse 39] The captain, barely breathing Kneeling at the wheel Above him and beneath him Fifty thousand tons of steel  [Verse 40] He looked over at his compass And he gazed into its face Needle pointing downward He knew he lost the race  [Verse 41] In the dark illumination He remembered bygone years He read the Book of Revelation And he filled his cup with tears  [Verse 42] When the Reaper's task had ended Sixteen hundred had gone to rest The good, the bad, the rich, the poor The loveliest and the best  [Verse 43] They waited at the landing And they tried to understand But there is no understanding For the judgment of God's hand  [Verse 44] The news came over the wires And struck with deadly force The love had lost its fires All things had run their course  [Verse 45] The watchman he lay dreaming Of all the things that can be He dreamed the Titanic was sinking Into the deep blue sea[Verse 1] Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son? And where have you been, my darling young one? I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard  [Chorus] And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall  [Verse 2] Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son? And what did you see, my darling young one? I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding I saw a white ladder all covered with water I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children  [Chorus] And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall  [Verse 3] And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son? And what did you hear, my darling young one? I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley  [Chorus] And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall  [Verse 4] Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son? And who did you meet, my darling young one? I met a young child beside a dead pony I met a white man who walked a black dog I met a young woman, her body was burning I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow I met one man who was wounded in love I met another man who was wounded in hatred  [Chorus] And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall  [Verse 5] And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son? And what will you do now, my darling young one? I’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest Where the people are many and their hands are all empty Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison And the executioner’s face is always well hidden Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten Where black is the color, where none is the number And I’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking But I’ll know my song well before I start singing  [Chorus] And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall[Verse 1] How many roads must a man walk down Before you call him a man?

[Chorus] Can’t keep my eyes from the circling sky Tongue-tied and twisted Just an earth-bound misfit, I  [Verse 2] Ice is forming on the tips of my wings Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything No navigator to find my way home Unladen, empty and turned to stone  [Pre-Chorus 1] A soul in tension that’s learning to fly Condition grounded but determined to try  [Chorus] Can’t keep my eyes from the circling skies Tongue-tied and twisted Just an earth-bound misfit, I  [Verse 3] Above the planet on a wing and a prayer My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air Across the clouds I see my shadow fly Out of the corner of my watering eye A dream unthreatened by the morning light Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night  [Pre-Chorus 2] There’s no sensation to compare with this Suspended animation, a state of bliss  [Chorus] Can’t keep my mind from the circling skies Tongue-tied and twisted Just an earth-bound misfit, I[Intro]  [Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright] Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand And everything is green and submarine  [Chorus 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright] And no one showed us to the land And no one knows the where's or why's But something stirs and something tries And starts to climb towards the light  [Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright] Strangers passing in the street By chance two separate glances meet And I am you And what I see is me And do I take you by the hand And lead you through the land And help me understand the best I can?

It's alright, we told you what to dream You dreamed of a big star He played a mean guitar He always ate in the Steak Bar He loved to drive in his Jaguar So welcome to the machine [Synthesizer Solo]  [Outro][Spoken Intro] — And disciplinary remains mercifully Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense Yes, yes Now which is it? I am sure of it  [Acoustic Guitar Intro]  [Verse] So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain? Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell? Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change, did you exchange A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?  [Guitar Solo]  [Chorus] How I wish, how I wish you were here We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year Runnin' over the same old ground, what have we found? The same old fears, wish you were here  [Instrumental Outro & Scatting][Verse 1: David Gilmour] You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking And after a while, you can work on points for style Like the club tie, and the firm handshake A certain look in the eye and an easy smile You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to So that when they turn their backs on you You'll get the chance to put the knife in  [Verse 2: David Gilmour] You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder As you get older Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south Hide your head in the sand Just another sad old man All alone and dying of cancer  [Instrumental: 03:05 - 6:46]  [Verse 3: David Gilmour] And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around So have a good drown, as you go down all alone Dragged down by the stone  [Interlude: 08:03 - 12:15] (Stone, stone, stone...)  [Verse 4: Roger Waters] Got to admit that I'm a little bit confused Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner Everything's done under the sun But you believe at heart everyone's a killer  [Instrumental: 13:26 - 15:19]  [Verse 5: Roger Waters] Who was born in a house full of pain Who was trained not to spit in the fan Who was told what to do by the man Who was broken by trained personnel Who was fitted with collar and chain Who was given a pat on the back Who was breaking away from the pack Who was only a stranger at home Who was ground down in the end Who was found dead on the phone Who was dragged down by the stone Who was dragged down by the stone[Verse: Roger Waters] If you didn't care what happened to me And I didn't care for you We would zigzag our way through the boredom and pain Occasionally glancing up through the rain Wondering which of the buggers to blame And watching for pigs on the wing[Intro] *Pig snorts*  [Verse 1: Roger Waters] Big man, pig man Haha, charade you are Wooh! You well-heeled big wheel Haha, charade you are And when your hand is on your heart You're nearly a good laugh, almost a joker With your head down in the pig bin Sayin', ""Keep on digging"" Pig stain on your fat chin What do you hope to find Down in the pig mine?  [Refrain: Roger Waters] You're nearly a laugh You're nearly a laugh, but you're really a cry  [Verse 2: Roger Waters] Bus stop rat bag Haha, charade you are You fucked up old hag Haha, charade you are You radiate cold shafts of broken glass You're nearly a good laugh Almost worth a quick grin You like the feel of steel You're hot stuff with a hatpin And good fun with a handgun  [Refrain: Roger Waters] You're nearly a laugh You're nearly a laugh, but you're really a cry  [Instrumental]  [Verse 3: Roger Waters] Hey you, Whitehouse Haha, charade you are You house proud town mouse Haha, charade you are You're tryin' to keep our feelings off the street You're nearly a real treat All tight lips and cold feet And do you feel abused? You! Gotta stem the evil tide And keep it all on the inside  [Refrain: Roger Waters] Mary, you're nearly a treat Mary, you're nearly a treat, but you're really a cry  [Instrumental Outro][Verse 1: Roger Waters] Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air You better watch out There may be dogs about I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen Things are not what they seem  [Verse 2: Roger Waters] What do you get for pretending the danger's not real Meek and obedient, you follow the leader Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel What a surprise! A look of terminal shock in your eyes Now things are really what they seem No, this is no bad dream  [Interlude] (stone, stone, stone...) The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want He makes me down to lie Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by With bright knives He releaseth my soul He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places He converteth me to lamb cutlets For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger When cometh the day we lowly ones Through quiet reflection, and great dedication Master the art of karate Lo, we shall rise up And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water  [Verse 3: Roger Waters] Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream Wave upon wave of demented avengers March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream Have you heard the news? The dogs are dead! You better stay home And do as you're told Get out of the road if you want to grow old[Instrumental][Verse 1: Roger Waters] The lunatic is on the grass The lunatic is on the grass Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs Got to keep the loonies on the path The lunatic is in the hall The lunatics are in my hall The paper holds their folded faces to the floor And every day the paperboy brings more  [Chorus: Roger Waters] And if the dam breaks open many years too soon And if there is no room upon the hill And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too I'll see you on the dark side of the moon  [Verse 2: Roger Waters & Peter Watts] The lunatic is in my head (Hahahahahahaha!) The lunatic is in my head You raise the blade You make the change You rearrange me till I'm sane You lock the door And throw away the key And there's someone in my head but it's not me  [Chorus: Roger Waters] And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear You shout and no one seems to hear And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes I'll see you on the dark side of the moon  [Outro: Peter Watts & Patricia Watts] I can't think of anything to say except Hahahahahahaha! I think it's marvellous! Hahaha...[Intro]  [Verse 1] Breathe, breathe in the air Don't be afraid to care Leave but don't leave me Look around and choose your own ground  [Chorus] For long you live and high you fly And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry And all you touch and all you see Is all your life will ever be  [Verse 2] Run, rabbit, run Dig that hole, forget the sun And when at last the work is done Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one  [Chorus] For long you live and high you fly But only if you ride the tide And balanced on the biggest wave You race towards an early grave[Verse: Roger Waters] All that you touch and all that you see All that you taste, all you feel And all that you love and all that you hate All you distrust, all you save And all that you give and all that you deal And all that you buy, beg, borrow, or steal And all you create and all you destroy And all that you do and all that you say And all that you eat and everyone you meet (Everyone you meet) And all that you slight and everyone you fight And all that is now and all that is gone And all that's to come and everything under the sun is in tune But the sun is eclipsed by the moon  [Outro] There is no dark side in the moon really Matter of fact it's all dark *Heartbeat*[Intro]  [Verse 1: David Gilmour] Money, get away You get a good job with more pay and you're okay Money, it's a gas Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash New car, caviar, four-star daydream Think I'll buy me a football team  [Verse 2: David Gilmour] Money, get back I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack Money, it's a hit Ah, don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set And I think I need a Lear jet  [Saxophone Solo]  [Guitar Solo]  [Verse 3: David Gilmour] Money, it's a crime Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie Money, so they say Is the root of all evil today But if you ask for a rise, it's no surprise That they're giving none away  [Outro: David Gilmour] Away, away, away Away, away, away Away, ooh...

There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime  [Lyricless vocals: Clare Torry]  [Bridge: Patricia Watts] I never said I was frightened of dying  [Lyricless vocals: Clare Torry][Intro]  [Verse 1: David Gilmour &amp; Richard Wright] Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown Waiting for someone or something to show you the way Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today And then one day you find ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun  [Guitar Solo]  [Verse 2: David Gilmour &amp; Richard Wright] And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking Racing around to come up behind you again The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say  [Outro: David Gilmour] Home, home again I like to be here when I can And when I come home cold and tired It's good to warm my bones beside the fire Far away across the field The tolling of the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spells[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright] Us (Us, us, us, us, us) and them (Them, them, them, them) And after all we're only ordinary men Me (Me, me, me, me, me) and you (You, you, you, you, you) God only knows it's not what we would choose to do ""Forward"" he cried from the rear And the front rank died The general sat and the lines on the map Moved from side to side  [Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright] Black (Black, black, black, black) and blue (Blue, blue, blue, blue) And who knows which is which and who is who Up (Up, up, up, up, up) and down (Down, down, down, down) And in the end it's only round and round, and round ""Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"" The poster bearer cried ""Listen, son,"" said the man with the gun ""There's room for you inside""  [Interlude] I mean, they're not gonna kill ya So like, if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock They won't do it again Dig it? I mean he get off lightly 'Cause I would've given him a thrashing I only hit him once! It was only a difference of opinion But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?  [Saxophone Solo]  [Verse 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright] Down (Down, down, down, down) and out (Out, out, out, out) It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about With (With, with, with, with), without And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about? Out of the way, it's a busy day I've got things on my mind For want of the price of tea and a slice The old man died[Intro]  [Verse 1] Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young In a world of magnets and miracles Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary The ringing of the division bell had begun Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway Do they still meet there by the Cut There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps Running before time took our dreams away Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground To a life consumed by slow decay  [Chorus] The grass was greener The light was brighter With friends surrounded The nights of wonder  [Verse 2] Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again Dragged by the force of some inner tide At a higher altitude with flag unfurled We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world  [Instrumental]  [Verse 3] Encumbered forever by desire and ambition There's a hunger still unsatisfied Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon Though down this road we've been so many times  [Chorus] The grass was greener The light was brighter The taste was sweeter The nights of wonder With friends surrounded The dawn mist glowing The water flowing The endless river For ever and ever  [Instrumental]  [Outro] ""Is that Charlie? Hello Charlie! Great...""[Intro]  [Verse 1] We bitch and we fight Diss each other on sight But this thing we do These times together Rain or shine or stormy weather This thing we do With world-weary grace We've taken our places We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name Or stay home by the fire, filled by desire Stoking the flame But we’re here for the ride  [Hook] It's louder than words This thing that we do Louder than words The way it unfurls It's louder than words The sum of our parts The beat of our hearts Is louder than words Louder than words  [Verse 2] The strings bend and slide As the hours glide by An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues Gonna tap out the rhythm Let's go with the flow, wherever it goes We're more than alive  [Hook] It's louder than words This thing that we do Louder than words The way it unfurls It's louder than words The sum of our parts The beat of our hearts Is louder than words Louder than words Louder than words This thing they call soul Is there with a pulse Louder than words Louder than words  [Guitar solo]  [Outro][Verse 1] Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes I can barely define the shape of this moment in time And far from flying high in clear blue skies I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide If you negotiate the minefield in the drive And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall Dial the combination, open the priesthole And if I'm in I'll tell you (What's behind the wall)  (Yahoo!)  [Verse 2] There's a kid who had a big hallucination Making love to girls in magazines He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith Could anybody love him Or is it just a crazy dream?  [Verse 3] And if I show you my dark side Will you still hold me tonight? And if I open my heart to you And show you my weak side What would you do? Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone? Would you take the children away And leave me alone? And smile in reassurance As you whisper down the phone? Would you send me packing? Or would you take me home?  [Verse 4] Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings Thought I oughta tear the curtain down I held the blade in trembling hands Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang I never had the nerve to make the final cut  [Outro] “Hello?

The_Doors,"Lions in the street and roaming Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming A beast caged in the heart of a city The body of his mother Rotting in the summer ground He fled the town  He went down South and crossed the border Left chaos and disorder Back there over his shoulder  One morning he awoke in a green hotel With a strange creature groaning beside him Sweat oozed from its shining skin Is everybody in? Is everybody in? Is everybody in? The ceremony is about to begin  Wake up! You can't remember where it was Had this dream stopped?
